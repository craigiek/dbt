{"name":"Dbt","tagline":"A simple tool designed to simplify the creation, migration and deletion of databases.","body":"The dbt plugin is designed to simplify the creation, migration and deletion of databases. Each database contains a number of _modules_ that are loaded and migrated in a specific order. Each _module_ is stored in a directory with the same name as the _module_ key used when defining the database.\r\n\r\n## Database Creation\r\n\r\nWhen a _module_ is loaded the plugin will attempt to load SQL scripts from a number of sub-directories of the _module_ dir. The SQL scripts in each directory are sorted alpha-numerically before being executed. The order in which directories are processed is configurable by Dbt::Configure.sql_dirs setting but defaults to:\r\n\r\n* .\r\n* types\r\n* views\r\n* functions\r\n* stored-procedures\r\n* triggers\r\n* misc\r\n\r\nAfter loading the SQL scripts the plugin will attempt to load fixture data from the 'fixtures' sub-directory of the _module_ dir. The fixture data must be in a YAML formated file that matches the table named with .yml appended. The order that the fixture data is loaded in is fixed and described in the \"Table Ordering\" section below.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
